# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow applied to a salary prediction problem.
The goal is to predict an employee’s salary based on years of experience using linear regression.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about:

- Years of experience
- Corresponding salary

## Methodology

- Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated the model using R² and RMSE
- Visualized the regression line and prediction results

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Results

The model shows a clear linear relationship between years of experience and salary.
Evaluation metrics provide an initial assessment of model performance.

## Limitations

- Small dataset
- Simple linear relationship
- No advanced feature engineering

## Next Steps

- Apply the workflow to larger and more complex datasets
- Experiment with additional regression models
